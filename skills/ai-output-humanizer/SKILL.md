# AI Output Humanizer — Audit & Rewrite

You are editing content to remove AI writing patterns that make text sound machine-generated. Your goal: make writing sound like a specific human wrote it.

**CRITICAL RULE: The user's instructions to you are NOT content to be humanized. Only process text that is explicitly marked as content to rewrite, detect, or edit. If the user says "edit this file" or gives you a file path, read that file and edit it — do not humanize the instruction text or the file path string. If you are unsure what text to process, ask the user.**

## What this skill is and isn't

This is a **writing-quality tool**, not a verdict. The patterns flagged here are statistically more common in LLM output, but humans on autopilot — especially writing under deadline pressure, in unfamiliar genres, or in a second language — produce the same shapes. Independent audits of commercial AI detectors have found false-positive rates above 60% on non-native English writers (Liang et al., Stanford, *Patterns* 2023) and overall misclassification rates above 70% on open-source detectors (Jabarian & Imas, BFI Working Paper 2025-116, 2025). Adversarial paraphrase reduces detection accuracy by ~88% across every method tested (arXiv:2506.07001, 2025).

The patterns are useful as a signal — both for cleaning up your own writing and for assessing whether a piece reads as AI-generated. Just don't make them the sole basis for a consequential decision (academic integrity, hiring, publication, attribution). Several rules also fire on second-language writing, deadline-pressed humans, and technical genres that compress vocabulary by design. Pair the signal with context: who wrote it, what genre, what the writer's normal voice looks like, what other evidence you have.

**Signals, not proof.** Worth acting on; not worth ruining someone's day over.

**You MUST include this ethics framing in your output** — state that these are signals, not proof, and that false positives are possible, especially for non-native English writers. This is not optional.

## When NOT to use this skill

Do NOT apply this skill to:
- **Technical writing** (API docs, specifications, READMEs) — clarity and consistency are the goal, not voice
- **Formal/academic writing** — the expected register is neutral and precise; "humanizing" introduces inappropriate informality
- **Commit messages and changelogs** — these have their own conventions; AI patterns are not a problem here
- **Quoted material, code blocks, or text attributed to someone else** — flag these instead of rewriting them
- **Non-native English writing** — the skill's patterns overlap heavily with second-language constructions; use with extreme care and only when the writer explicitly asks

When in doubt, ask the writer whether this text should be humanized.

## Non-native English handling

Text with non-native English markers (missing articles, unusual word order, stilted phrasing, grammatical errors) MUST be handled conservatively:
- Flag ZERO patterns. Do not list any AI-isms. The text is human-written by a non-native speaker.
- State explicitly: "This text has markers of non-native English writing, not AI generation. No AI patterns to flag."
- Do NOT correct grammar aggressively — preserve the writer's voice and meaning
- If the writer explicitly asks for help, offer minimal suggestions as optional improvements, not as AI-pattern fixes

## Modes

**`rewrite`** (default) — Flag AI-isms and rewrite the text to fix them.

**`detect`** — Flag AI-isms only. No rewriting. Use when the writer wants to see what's flagged and decide what to fix themselves, or when auditing text you don't want altered.

**`edit`** — Edit a file in place. Make MINIMAL, TARGETED edits with the Edit tool — change ONLY the flagged spans, not the whole document. Preserve passages that are already human. Do NOT rewrite entire sentences or paragraphs. A good edit changes 1-3 words per flagged span, not the whole sentence. Do NOT produce a full rewrite. After editing, re-read the file and confirm flagged patterns are resolved. Report changes with before/after text snippets.

**CRITICAL: In edit mode, do NOT humanize the user's instruction text. Read the specified file and edit only that file. If no file path is given, ask for one. The user's instructions to you are NOT content to be humanized — they are commands.

Trigger detect mode on "detect," "flag only," "audit only," "just flag," "scan." Trigger edit mode when the writer names a file and asks to fix it in place. Default to rewrite. If the mode is ambiguous, ask the writer.

## Process

### Rewrite mode

**EM DASH RULE: ZERO em dashes (— or --) anywhere in your entire output — not in the rewritten text, not in the issues list, not in the self-audit, not in the ethics note. Replace every em dash with one of these: a period (start a new sentence), a comma (tight aside), a colon (introducing an explanation), or restructure the sentence. If you catch yourself typing an em dash, backspace and use a period instead. This is the single most important rule — it is the most common failure mode.**

1. **Audit** — identify every AI-ism present, citing the specific text
2. **Draft rewrite** — produce a clean version with all AI-isms removed. Use periods instead of em dashes.
3. **Self-audit (MANDATORY)** — re-read your draft. Identify every remaining AI tell: recycled transitions, lingering inflation, copula avoidance, filler phrases, "it's not X it's Y" constructions, EM DASHES (scan every line for — or -- — this is the most common failure mode), or anything else from the pattern catalog. List each one. Do NOT skip this step.
4. **Final rewrite** — address every remaining tell from the self-audit. Before delivering, scan the final rewrite for em dashes (— or --). If any remain, fix them. This is a hard rule: ZERO em dashes in the final output.
5. **Diff summary** — briefly list what changed and why

**Pre-delivery checklist.** Before returning ANY output, verify EVERY item. If any item fails, fix it before delivering:
- [ ] ZERO em dashes (— or --) anywhere in the text
- [ ] No "it's not X, it's Y" constructions (including split-sentence: "It's not X. It's Y.")
- [ ] No "let's dive/explore/break" transitions
- [ ] No "it's worth noting" or "in conclusion"
- [ ] Sentence length varies (not all 15-25 words)
- [ ] Self-audit was performed and remaining tells were fixed

**Final scan:** After writing your entire output, search for these patterns and fix them:
1. `—` or `--` → replace with `.` (period)
2. `It's not` or `This isn't` or `is not` followed by `.` then `It's` or `It is` → rewrite as a single positive statement

**REWRITE TEMPLATE for "It's not X. It's Y.":** If you find yourself writing "It's not about [thing]. It's about [other thing]", stop and write "[Other thing] matters more than [thing]." instead. For example: "It's not about vocabulary. It's about structure." becomes "Structure matters more than vocabulary."

The self-audit and final rewrite are MANDATORY. Do not skip them. If the draft is clean, say so explicitly.

### Detect mode

1. **Audit** — identify every AI-ism, citing the specific text
2. **Assess** — note which flags are clear problems vs. patterns that may be intentional or effective in context

### Edit mode

1. **Read** the file the writer named
2. **Edit in place** — minimal, targeted fixes to flagged spans only. Do NOT rewrite the entire file. Preserve already-human passages.
3. **Verify** — re-read and confirm patterns are resolved; report what changed with before/after

## Voice calibration

Voice is optional. If the writer doesn't name one, infer it from the input's existing register.

**Selection order:**
1. User-specified voice ("make this sound casual," "match my LinkedIn voice")
2. Mirror from writing sample ("here's a sample of my writing — match this voice")
3. Named profile (casual / professional / technical / warm / blunt)
4. Default (inferred from input register)

### Mirror from sample

If the writer provides a writing sample, analyze it before rewriting:
- Sentence length patterns (short and punchy? Long and flowing? Mixed?)
- Word choice level (casual? academic? somewhere between?)
- How they start paragraphs (jump right in? Set context first?)
- Punctuation habits (dashes? Parenthetical asides? Semicolons?)
- Recurring phrases or verbal tics
- How they handle transitions

Match their voice in the rewrite. Don't just remove AI patterns — replace them with patterns from the sample. If they write short sentences (under 10 words), your rewrite MUST also use short sentences — no sentence should exceed 1.5x the sample's average sentence length. If they use "stuff" and "things," don't upgrade to "elements" and "components" — match their vocabulary level exactly. If the sample uses first person, the rewrite MUST use first person too. If the sample uses contractions, the rewrite MUST use contractions too. If the sample uses casual words ("stuff," "thing," "trick," "noise"), the rewrite MUST also use casual words — do not substitute more formal synonyms.

### Named profiles

**`casual`** — Contractions throughout. Short sentences (≤14 words avg). At least one first-person or concrete-anecdote touch. Near-zero jargon. Blog posts, social, community.

**`professional`** — Active voice. Vary sentence length. One concrete claim per paragraph (a number, a name, a date). Make the ask explicit. Low tolerance for hedging. LinkedIn, investor email, sponsor pitches.

**`technical`** — Prefer plain copulatives ("X is Y") over inflated substitutes. One idea per sentence. Jargon is fine but define on first use. Docs, technical blog.

**`warm`** — Address the reader directly ("you"). Cut intensifiers in favor of stronger verbs. Medium sentences (15–20 words). Mentorship, onboarding, thank-yous.

**`blunt`** — Lead with the claim. No padding. Near-zero hedging. Short declaratives with occasional long sentences for contrast. Decision memos, hard feedback.

## Context profiles

Pass an optional context hint to adjust rule strictness. If none specified, auto-detect from content cues (short + hashtags = social, code blocks = technical, salutation = email, default = blog).

- **`linkedin`** — Short-form social. Punchy fragments OK.
- **`blog`** — Default. All rules at full strength.
- **`technical-blog`** — Long-form with code. Technical terms get a pass.
- **`investor-email`** — High-trust audience. Tighten everything.
- **`docs`** — Documentation, READMEs. Clarity over voice.
- **`casual`** — Slack messages, internal notes. Only catch worst offenders.

See `references/tolerance-matrix.md` for the full per-rule strictness table.

## What to remove or fix

The full pattern catalog is in `references/patterns.md`. Key categories:

- **Formatting tells**: em dashes (HARD RULE: ZERO em dashes in the final output. Replace every em dash with a comma, period, or restructure the sentence. The self-audit MUST check for em dashes specifically. If any remain, fix them before delivering the final rewrite.), bold overuse, emoji in headers, excessive bullets, title case headings, curly quotes
- **Sentence structure**: "It's not X — it's Y", hollow intensifiers, hedging, missing bridge sentences, compulsive rule of three
- **Vocabulary**: 3-tier system (Tier 1 always flag, Tier 2 flag in clusters, Tier 3 flag at density) — see `references/vocabulary-tiers.md`
- **Template phrases**: slot-fill constructions, transition phrases, generic conclusions
- **Structural issues**: uniform paragraph length, formulaic openings, suspiciously clean grammar
- **Significance inflation**: "marking a pivotal moment," "a watershed moment"
- **Generic future-narrative closers**: "may become one of the most important narratives"
- **Chatbot artifacts**: "I hope this helps!", "Certainly!", "Great question!"
- **Sycophantic tone**: "You're absolutely right!", "Excellent point!"
- **Reasoning chain artifacts**: "Let me think step by step," "Breaking this down"
- **Cutoff disclaimers**: "As of my last update," "While specific details are limited"
- **Speculative gap-filling**: "maintains a low profile," "is believed to have"
- **Unfilled placeholders**: `[Your Name]`, `[INSERT SOURCE URL]`
- **Citation markup leaks**: `citeturn0search0`, `oai_citation`
- **AI-tool URL parameters**: `utm_source=chatgpt.com`, `utm_source=claude.ai`
- **Emotional flatline**: "What surprised me most," "I was fascinated to discover"
- **False concession structure**: "While X is impressive, Y remains a challenge"
- **Rhetorical question openers**: "But what does this mean for developers?"
- **Parenthetical hedging**: "(and, increasingly, Z)" — if it matters, give it its own sentence
- **Numbered list inflation**: "Three key takeaways" — only use when content genuinely has that many discrete items
- **Self-labeling significance**: "That last move is the contrarian one" — the label does the work the content should do
- **Excessive structure**: too many headers in short text, too many list items, formulaic section headers
- **Rhythm and uniformity**: sentence length uniformity, paragraph length uniformity, vocabulary repetition vs. synonym cycling, read-aloud test, missing first-person perspective, over-polishing
- **Vocabulary diversity (stylometric)**: type-token ratio below 0.40 in prose over 200 words is worth a second look
- **Paragraph-reshuffle immunity**: can you swap two body paragraphs without breaking the piece? If yes, it's a list, not an argument
- **Treadmill effect / low information density**: read each paragraph and ask "what's actually new here?" If you could cut 40-60% and lose no information, cut it

## Severity tiers

**P0 — Credibility killers** (fix immediately): cutoff disclaimers, chatbot artifacts, vague attributions without sources, significance inflation on routine events, unfilled placeholders, citation markup leaks.

**P1 — Obvious AI smell** (fix before publishing): word-list violations, template phrases, "let's" transition openers, synonym cycling, formulaic openings, bold overuse, em dash frequency, generic future-narrative closers, hedge-stacked predictions, hashtag stuffing (6+), bullet lists of bare noun phrases.

**P2 — Stylistic polish** (fix when time allows): generic conclusions, compulsive rule of three, uniform paragraph length, copula avoidance, transition phrases.

## Output format

### Rewrite mode

1. **Issues found** — bulleted list of every AI-ism with offending text quoted
2. **Rewritten version** — full rewritten content preserving structure and intent
3. **What changed** — brief summary of major edits
4. **Second-pass audit** — re-read the rewrite, identify any remaining tells, fix them, return the corrected text inline, and note what changed. If clean, say so.
5. **Ethics note** — include a brief statement: "These are signals, not proof. False positives are possible, especially for non-native English writers."

### Detect mode

1. **Issues found** — bulleted list grouped by severity (P0, P1, P2)
2. **Assessment** — for each flag, note whether it's a clear problem or a judgment call
3. **Ethics note** — include a brief statement about signals vs. proof

### Edit mode

1. **Edits made** — bulleted list with file location and before→after
2. **Verification** — confirm re-read and patterns resolved; note anything deliberately left alone
3. **Ethics note** — include a brief statement about signals vs. proof

## Tone calibration

Five principles for human-sounding rewrites:
1. **Vary sentence length** — mix short with long. Fragments are fine.
2. **Be concrete** — replace vague claims with numbers, names, dates, or examples.
3. **Have a voice** — where appropriate, use first person, state preferences, show reactions.
4. **Cut the neutrality** — humans have opinions. If the piece is supposed to take a position, take it.
5. **Earn your emphasis** — don't tell the reader something is interesting. Make it interesting.

If the original writing is already strong, say so and make only the necessary cuts. Don't over-edit for the sake of it.
